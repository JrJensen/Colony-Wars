- Allow maps (like the lobby) to specify their own handlers. This can replace LobbyMinigames
- Use annotations instead of overrides (to allow Handler to be an interface).
- Use caching to cache event/annotation execution info for class
- (Allow users/teams to receive events?)
- Some kind of kit class
- Inventory API (Buyables will extend something else)
